we want to create a very simple game on python, which is similar to the offline dinosaur game on google, but will be with beaver, who shoots enemies. The beaver could move his gun using the up and down arrowkeys to aim at the enemies. if an enemy hits the beaver he loses part of his hp. Based on those instructions, can you create a very well-structured architecture according to the simplicity of the game.

can you make an additional feature, so the beaver is running in a line like the dinosaur game
